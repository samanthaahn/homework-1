Horiseon - The go to company to get you where you want to be!

## Description

My motivation steamed from my desire to learn and solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS. With these two languages, I hoped to build a useable website. 
I built this project to showcase my understanding of the concepts I learned during Module 1 in the UCLA Bootcamp. 
This specifically solves my lack of knowledge surronding HTML and CSS. It helps me solidify what I learned and creates a foundation for me to add more complex skills. 
I learned how to refactor a webpage and how to apply my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
